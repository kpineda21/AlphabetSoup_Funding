## Challenge 
- Two layers were tested, Layer 1 = 2000 and Layer 2 = 1500. Since the data set provided was so large, I decided that we needed the layers to also increase in size to get the most accurate results. 
- We were able to achieve the target model performace. The test data results were: Loss: Accuracy: In order to recieve the most acurate reading we had to increase the batch size. Sice the data set was , when the batch size was small the acuracy was 99% however with such a large data set, the small batch was not providing an accurate result. 
- 

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
